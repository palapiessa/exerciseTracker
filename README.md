# exerciseTracker
Excercise tracker created with Termux on Android, in Python.
Background:
I thought to try how my android phone could be used for programming. With my mobile phone I can try coding while commuting or waiting for something.
I first tried QPython which is Python development tool for mobile phone. There was nothing wrong with QPython itself but I ran to problems with android’s security model. I was not able to connect my database from QPython code and I did not want to break security by rooting my phone.
I then discovered TermUX which is a console, linux-like environment for android. Applications can be installed to TermUX with pkg install– command. For example vim is installed like this: pkg install vim. 
SQLite  is in-built in android so database and tables can be created from command line. So there is everything available for my small project, coding can be begin!
